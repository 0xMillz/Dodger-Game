#Functions and Uses:

I'm creating a "dodger" game for my personal project. Objects will fall from the top of the game screen and your character at the bottom
will have to dodge them as they fall past. If you are hit by a falling object the game is over. Your score will be based on time survived + bonus points for every level completed. 
After every 20 seconds of survival you will advance to a new world with the speed and frequency of the falling objects increased. You will control your player
with the up, down, right and left keyboard keys. Gameplay will look similar to this:

## Technologies:
I will use javascript and html5 canvas to create the game. The page will be styled with bootstrap and css.

## Features

The game will feature a clock and a real-time score. For every second of survival the player will get two points. Advancing to a new level will earn you 100 points.
I am considering giving players the option to select a skill level before the game starts that will set the variables for the
speed of the falling objects.
